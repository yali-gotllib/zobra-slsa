# Go Package SLSA Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What We Attempted

We created a Go package (`zobra-go`) to demonstrate the **official SLSA Go builder** and compare it with our Python implementation.

## 📦 Go Package Created

### Files Created:
- ✅ `main.go` - Simple Go CLI application
- ✅ `go.mod` - Go module definition
- ✅ `.slsa-goreleaser.yml` - GoReleaser configuration for SLSA builder
- ✅ `.github/workflows/go-slsa-build.yml` - Official SLSA Go builder workflow
- ✅ `README-GO.md` - Documentation

### Package Features:
```bash
go run main.go           # Show usage
go run main.go version   # Show version
go run main.go info      # Show package info
go run main.go hello SLSA # Say hello
```

## 🔧 SLSA Configuration

### Official Go Builder Used:
```yaml
uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/builder_go_slsa3.yml@v2.0.0
```

### Expected Benefits:
- ✅ **Trusted by slsa-verifier** (unlike Python generator)
- ✅ **Official SLSA Level 3 provenance**
- ✅ **Multi-platform builds** (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- ✅ **Automatic release creation**

## ❌ Issue Encountered

### Problem:
The official SLSA Go builder failed with:
```
This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of 
`actions/upload-artifact: a8a3f3ad30e3422c9c7b888a15615d19a852ae32`
```

### Root Cause:
- The SLSA Go builder internally uses deprecated GitHub Actions
- This affects both v1.10.0 and v2.0.0 of the SLSA generator
- GitHub has deprecated older versions of `actions/upload-artifact`

### Impact:
- ❌ **Build fails** before generating provenance
- ❌ **No artifacts produced** to verify
- ❌ **Cannot demonstrate slsa-verifier success**

## 🔍 What This Reveals

### About SLSA Ecosystem:
1. **Even official builders can have compatibility issues**
2. **SLSA framework needs maintenance** to keep up with GitHub Actions changes
3. **Supply chain security tools face their own supply chain challenges**

### About Language Support:
1. **Go has official support** but with current technical issues
2. **Python has no official builder** but generators work
3. **Ecosystem maturity varies** significantly by language

## 🆚 Comparison: Python vs Go SLSA

| Aspect | Python (zobra) | Go (zobra-go) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Builder Type** | Generic Generator | Official Go Builder |
| **Implementation** | ✅ Working | ❌ Currently broken |
| **Provenance Generated** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (build fails) |
| **slsa-verifier Trust** | ❌ "Untrusted" | ✅ Would be "Trusted" |
| **Practical Usability** | ✅ High | ❌ Low (due to bugs) |

## 🎯 Key Insights

### What We Learned:
1. **Python SLSA works well** with generic generators
2. **Official builders aren't always better** (can have bugs)
3. **"Untrusted" doesn't mean "insecure"** - it's about policy
4. **SLSA ecosystem is still maturing** - even official tools have issues

### Practical Recommendations:
1. **For Python**: Use generic generator (as we did) - it works!
2. **For Go**: Wait for SLSA builder fixes or use generic generator
3. **For Production**: Test thoroughly regardless of "official" status
4. **For Security**: Focus on cryptographic verification, not just "trust" labels

## 🚀 Next Steps

If we wanted to complete the Go demonstration:

### Option 1: Wait for Fix
- Monitor SLSA framework updates
- Retry when deprecated actions are updated

### Option 2: Use Generic Generator for Go
- Create Go build with generic generator (like Python)
- Would work but be "untrusted" by slsa-verifier

### Option 3: Manual Build
- Build Go binaries manually
- Generate provenance with generic generator
- Demonstrate verification process

## 🏆 Overall Success

Despite the Go builder issue, we successfully demonstrated:
- ✅ **Complete SLSA workflow** with Python
- ✅ **Official SLSA provenance generation**
- ✅ **Cryptographic verification**
- ✅ **Understanding of trust models**
- ✅ **Real-world challenges** in SLSA ecosystem

**The Python implementation remains our successful SLSA demonstration!**
